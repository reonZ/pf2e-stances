# FoundryVTT PF2e Stances

This module will help players manage their character's stances (only stances which originate from feats will be handled).

![](./readme/stances.webp)

A new section displaying your stances will be added at the top of the action tab of the character sheet.

Clicking on a stance will add its effect to the character while removing all other stance effects currently existing.

![](./readme/nocombat.webp)

The stances will not be normally available if the character is not part of an encounter, but a user can still force the stance by using `ctrl+click`.

When leaving an encounter, the stance effects will be removed from the character automatically.

If a feat override a stance in the system, the upgraded version of the stance effect will be used instead (i.e. if the character has both `Gorilla Stance` and `Gorilla Pound` feats, the effect of the later will be used but the name of the stance in the tab will still be `Gorilla Stance`).

New effects have been added for all the stances that didn't have one in the system for convenience.

# Stance Savant

![](./readme/menu.webp)

The module will handle `Stance Savant` by automatically entering a stance if only one exist on the character or open a window asking to select one when the character joins a new encounter.

# Custom Stances

You can register your own combos of `feat` + `effect` in the settings. To do so, you need to provide a valid JSON array of objects with a `feat` and `effect` keys containing their respective UUIDs.

    [{ "feat": "Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AN9jY1JVcU20Qdw6", "effect": "Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.b2kWJuCPj1rDMdwz" }]
